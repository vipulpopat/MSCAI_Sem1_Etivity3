    "- Create your own implementation of linear classification to perform a classification of the dataset provided in the Etivity3_LinearClassification.ipynb notebook without adding extra features to those provided. Use normal linear regression with sign(wTx) to obtain a classification. Notebook Etivity3_LinearClassification.ipynb is available in the git repository. Add your code to this notebook.\n",
